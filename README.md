# CS2610
A repository of the lab work done in the Computer Organization and Architecure Lab

The lab component of this course, conducted during the Spring 2021 semester as a part of the CSE curriculum of IITM, aimed at givings us hands on experience with assembly language coding, so as to expose us to the capabilities and limitations of current processor technologies.

In addition to this, the 5th assignment was based on performance tools available to analyze the performance of our computer while executing a given program.

This 6th and 8th assignments were to simulate the logical implementation of a Cache and a MIPS processor respectively. These two assignments were group projects, and my teammates were [Samuel Moses](https://github.com/SamuelMosesA) and [Shree Vishnu](https://github.com/shvishnu)
